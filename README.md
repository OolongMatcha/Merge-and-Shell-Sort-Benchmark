# Merge-and-Shell-Sort-Benchmark
This is a Benchmark program I developed in Java for my CMSC 451 class that compares the perormance bwtween the Merge sort and Shell Sort algorithms.
It specifically compares the average and coefficience of variance between the critical count and time between both algorithms.

The program has two options: one for generating the data and another for displaying said data on a table.
Data is generated by supplying the algorithms with 12 arrays of randomized data, whose size differs by 100 (100, 200, 300, etc.).
The data is then sorted by both algorithms and their total critical count and time elapsed will be recorded in two text files, one for each algorithm.
The name of the files will be mergeReport.txt and shellReport.txt.

The second option lets the user select one of the two files they generated to be displayed on a table. The program calculates the averages and
coefficient of variance between the selected algorithm's critical count and time elapsed.
